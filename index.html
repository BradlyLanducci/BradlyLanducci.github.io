      <h3>About Me</h3>
      Having just completed my schooling at the Conservatory of Recording Arts and Sciences I have now moved out to the Portland area to look for work the in the Audio industry. I'm following my passion and am determined to find an entry level position within a recording studio. I have tons of experience recording and mixing on the SSL 9000, SSL AWS948, and API Legacy + consoles. To me however it's more than a job as it's something I love to do and would love to continue learning and helping other artists reach their dreams as well.
