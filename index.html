      <h3>About Me</h3>
      This website showcases my (Bradly Landucci's) work so far.

      I previously went to school at the Conservatory of Recording Arts and Sciences, where I studied audio engineering and grew a large passion for all things audio. Shortly after finishing that certificate program, I ended up at Oregon State Univeristy. This is where I'm currently finishing my bachelor's degree in Computer Science, with a focus in audio and signal processing. I've worked on many different DSP related code projects, such as Orbit, a VST plugin designed by me. I've also work in a lab at my college where I do audio analysis of AI synthesized instruments.
