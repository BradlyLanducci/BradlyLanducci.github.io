      <h3>Synthetic Instrument Generation</h3>
      2.1 I think that the user base for our project would grow over time. Since AI is one of the largest growing fields in Computer Science, and AI related art is also growing, it is also expected the demand for our project will also increase. As of now there are other music AI related projects such as MuseNet which generates musical compositions with already existing instruments. However, the instruments themselves are not something that currently has been developed. For this reason, I believe that the user base will only grow once we can officially begin trials. 

This product will be one of a kind, and allow musicians to effortlessly obtain and use in their own productions. This allowance for creativity and accessibility that we will provide is something that is really good for the music industry. Since this is so far intended to be free for use, this will definitely save musicians money and time. The time it takes to synthesize your own instruments, creatively, can be very extensive. It’s often the case that someone needs initial motivation or inspiration, and by trying new things it can help lead to where they want to go. That’s a huge goal of mine in this project. To be able to help this user base expand their own creativity.


2.2 This product will use additive synthesis to create electro acoustic instruments, therefore its goal is to model real instruments. With this being said it should be creating new instruments based off of the analysis of real sounds. Due to this, we will not be necessarily creating vastly new and odd sounds. The goal is for them to be familiar but different. Other requirements involve being simple to use. This should adhere to the workflow of music production, so it must work fast. No one wants to be sitting around for hours in order to use a product, especially in the modern day.
