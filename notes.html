  <h2>V1.01 Notes</h2>
  - Fixed GUI lag due to constant repainting of window.

  <h2>V1.02 Notes</h2>
  - Fixed Ping Pong mode so that it accurately jumps from left to right instead of slowly summing to mono.
  <br>
  - Width is now wider and goes up to 1000 samples of delay.
  <br>
  - The mod now goes to 4 Hz, and uses a new more intensive algorithm. It now should sound less harsh.
  <br>
  - Fixed shading on buttons when hovered over.
  <br>
  - Peaking filters now are wide Q.
  <br>
  - HPF and LPF now go from 20 - 10000 Hz, it felt pointless for them to go higher.
  <br>
  - Feedback can now go up to 1.0, which is an infinite delay.
  <br>
  - Gain rescaled to go to 8.0, unity is now 4.0.
