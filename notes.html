    <h3>Orbit Release Notes</h3>
      
      <h5>V1.01 Notes</h5>
      - Fixed GUI lag due to constant repainting of window.
    
      <h5>V1.02 Notes</h5>
      - Fixed Ping Pong mode so that it accurately jumps from left to right instead of slowly summing to mono.
      <br>
      - Width is now wider and goes up to 1000 samples of delay.
      <br>
      - The mod now goes to 4 Hz, and uses a new more intensive algorithm. It now should sound less harsh.
      <br>
      - Fixed shading on buttons when hovered over.
      <br>
      - Peaking filters now are wide Q.
      <br>
      - HPF and LPF now go from 20 - 10000 Hz, it felt pointless for them to go higher.
      <br>
      - Feedback can now go up to 1.0, which is an infinite delay.
      <br>
      - Gain rescaled to go to 8.0, unity is now 4.0.
